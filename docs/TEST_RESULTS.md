# Test Results - Autonomous Inspiration System

## Summary

All integration tests now pass after transitioning from Unsplash-based to autonomous inspiration system.

## Test Results

✅ **14/14 tests passing** in integration/test_creation_flow.py

### Fixed Issues

1. **Memory JSON Corruption**
   - Issue: `data/lumira_memory.json` had incomplete JSON at line 21
   - Fix: Reset to valid empty structure
   - Status: ✅ Resolved

2. **Test Expectations Updated**
   - Issue: Tests expected `get_random_photo()` calls (old Unsplash behavior)
   - Fix: Updated tests to expect autonomous inspiration
   - Tests updated:
     - `test_creation_flow_with_theme` - No longer checks for Unsplash calls
     - `test_creation_flow_autonomous` - Now validates autonomous generation
     - `test_unsplash_failure_propagates` → `test_autonomous_inspiration_works`
   - Status: ✅ Resolved

## System Validation

The test logs confirm autonomous inspiration is working:

```
[info] autonomous_inspiration_initialized moods=25 styles=47 subjects=91
[info] exploration_generated prompt='silence, vibrant style, bright mood' theme=silence
[info] lumira_original_vision base_prompt='silence, vibrant style...' mode=exploration
[info] artwork_created creation_type=autonomous_original
```

## Code Coverage

- **Total: 30%** (baseline established)
- Key modules:
  - `main.py`: 61% (core creation flow)
  - `moods.py`: 86% (mood system)
  - `cognition.py`: 80% (thinking)
  - `autonomous.py`: 47% (new module)

## Recommendations from Research

### Based on AUTOMATIC1111/Stable-Diffusion-WebUI

1. **✅ Already Implemented:**
   - Negative prompts for bias mitigation
   - CFG scale control
   - Step scheduling
   - Batch generation

2. **🔄 Consider Adding:**
   - Prompt matrix (combinations)
   - Style presets system
   - Emphasis markers for prompt weighting
   - X/Y/Z plot grids for parameter sweeps

### Based on InvokeAI

1. **✅ Already Implemented:**
   - Dynamic prompts (autonomous generation)
   - Queue-based generation
   - Model management
   - Text encoder handling

2. **🔄 Consider Adding:**
   - Per-prompt vs per-iteration seed control
   - Regional guidance (ControlNet layers)
   - Canvas mode for composition
   - Batch count predictions

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Fix remaining pre-commit hook issues (formatting, type hints)
2. 🔄 Research and implement style preset system
3. 🔄 Add prompt weighting/emphasis
4. 🔄 Monitor Railway deployment completion
5. 🔄 Test web UI once deployed

## Notes

- Autonomous inspiration system is fully operational
- No external API dependencies for core functionality
- Unsplash remains available as optional feature
- Memory system working, enhanced memory at 341 episodes
